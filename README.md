- **Runtime Support**:
  - Process
  - Docker Container
  - *Future Support*: WebAssembly and Kubernetes (K8s)
  
- **Operating Modes**:
  - **Local Mode**: Run a single AI agent workload on a local machine.
  - **Cluster Mode**: Designed to support AI agent workloads across multiple clusters. *(Not yet implemented)*
  
- **Deployment**:
  - **Auto deployment**: Auto Generate configuration files based on programming code.

- **Agent Service**:
  - **Planning**: Offer some agent planning technology enhancing agent ability.
  - **Memory**: Provide some memory services to manage the knowledge of the agent.
  - **Tools**: Provide the user with some built-in tools, and allow the user to customize their own tools.

## Linux OS installation 

### Dependencies
  SPEAR relies on some other third-party software dependency packages. To install this packages on Linux, use the following command:
  
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install build
  apt install portaudio19-dev libx11-dev libxtst-dev
  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
  sh get-docker.sh
  ```

### Build Instructions

To build SPEAR and its related components, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This command will:
 - Compile all required binaries.
 - Build Docker images for the related AI Agent workloads.

### Usage

To run SPEAR in local mode, use the following command:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN>
export SPEAR_RPC_ADDR=<YOUR_LOCAL_SPEAR_RPC_ADDR>
bin/worker exec -n pyconversation
```

This command will:
 - Start the SPEAR worker process in local mode.
 - Run the AI agent workload with an ID of 6. (pyconversation-local)

Also, you need to set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key. In the future, we will support other LLM providers.



## Mac OS installation 

### Dependencies
  PortAudio is required for the audio processing component. To install PortAudio on MacOS, use the following command:
  
  ```bash
  brew install portaudio
  ```
### Build Instructions

To build SPEAR and its related components, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This command will:
 - Compile all required binaries.
 - Build Docker images for the related AI Agent workloads.

### Usage

To run SPEAR in local mode, use the following command:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
bin/worker exec -n pyconversation
```

This command will:
 - Start the SPEAR worker process in local mode.
 - Run the AI agent workload with an ID of 6. (pyconversation-local)

Also, you need to set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key. In the future, we will support other LLM providers.


### Development Status

 Supported Runtimes:
 - Process
 - Docker Container
  
 Planned Runtimes:
 - WebAssembly
 - Kubernetes

## Future Plans

 - Implementation of cluster mode to enable distributed AI agent workloads across multiple clusters.
 - Expansion of runtime support to include WebAssembly and Kubernetes.
